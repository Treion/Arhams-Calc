# ARHAM'S CALC

This is litterally my first coding project, 
it is very bad and can not process complex tasks

The welcome message is an ASCII ART, I made using an online generator and
the code is just simple raw python operators and if-else logics.

Thanks to my python and IGCSE Computer Science teacher: Rubait Sir
